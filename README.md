# Sim2Real Unsupervised SAR Target Classification
This is the code for the paper "Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for SAR Target Classification based on Domain- and Class-level Alignment: from Simulated to Real Data". Our paper is underreview by the ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING. Our codes will be made public in the near future (about three months after the article is accepted).
